# Perspectography

**This project is very much in an alpha stage right now! Use at your own risk.**

Perspectography is an EXPath suite of tools for publishing 'ographies - lists of people, places, events, bibliographic entries, etc. - using TEI-encoded XML. These tools include:

* a TEI ODD file and its derived RelaxNG schema; and
* an API to query 'ography data, powered by RESTXQ.
