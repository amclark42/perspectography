      <change who="amclark42" when="2020-03-26">Incorporated @sydb's suggestions into the 
        definition for <gi>persPronouns</gi>. (Thanks, Syd!) Added sample encoding.</change>
      <change who="amclark42" when="2020-03-25">Changed <att>persPronouns</att> to <gi>persPronouns</gi>, 
        since personal pronouns can be known when gender identity is not. The new element is based 
        on <gi>tei:sex</gi>.</change>
      <change who="amclark42" when="2020-03-07">Updated to TEI version 4.0.0. Added a custom 
        attribute <att>persPronouns</att> to <gi>gender</gi>. There are queer authors whose gender 
        identities I can't find (the process of looking feels invasive, too), and I would rather 
        not assume a <att>value</att>. I often can find their pronouns, however, and I would like 
        to use those instead of <att>value</att>. Also, programmatically applied the Library of 
        Congress relation descriptions to the values listed for <code lang="xpath">//resp/@n</code>.</change>
      <change who="amclark42" when="2019-02-24">Added <gi>catRef</gi> to model.imprintPart, which
        should allow <gi>catRef</gi> as a child of <gi>bibl</gi>. <gi>trait</gi> just feels to me 
        like a poor placeholder for the category reference I really mean.</change>
      <change who="amclark42" when="2017-10-01">Changed added attribute <att>relation</att> to a 
        modification of <att>n</att>.</change>
      <change who="amclark42" when="2017-08-20">Changed <att>relation</att> and <gi>gender</gi>'s 
        <att>value</att> to use the string datatype. Removed many excluded elements.</change>
      <change who="amclark42" when="2017-08-13">Updated to TEI version 3.2.0, which adds 
        <gi>persona</gi>.</change>
      <change who="amclark42" when="2016-05-15">Added "tagdocs" module.</change>
      <change who="amclark42" when="2016-04-03">Changed the datatype of <att>value</att> on 
        <gi>gender</gi> to 'text', so that spaces are allowed as input.</change>
      <change who="amclark42" when="2016-03-04">Replaced <gi>pcvdGender</gi> with a modified 
        version of TEI's <gi>sex</gi>, renamed to <gi>gender</gi> and given a default 
        <att>evidence</att> value of "conjecture." Greatly expanded the list of suggested values 
        for <att>value</att> on <gi>gender</gi>, and added descriptions. Allowed several elements 
        previously excluded from the schema.</change>
      <change who="amclark42" when="2016-01">Added W3C date attributes to <gi>catRef</gi>.</change>
      <change who="amclark42" when="2015-11">Created first draft.</change>
